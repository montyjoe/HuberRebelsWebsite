        <div class="article-content">
          <p>One  year  ago  at  E3  2017,  Mojang  announced  at  Microsoft’s  press  conference  that  they  would  be  bringing <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/all-news-e3" class="article-link" target="_blank">two  new  updates  to  the  game</a>.  One  of  the  updates  would  be  brand  new  4K  graphics  that  would  give  the  game  a  significant  visual  upgrade.  While  there  have  been  mods  for  the  Java  version  on  PC  that  have  achieved  the  same  results,  this  would  be  bringing  the  updated  visuals  to  the  entire  Minecraft  community.  The  bigger  update  of  the  two  would  be  the  Better  Together  Update,  promising  to  unite  the  console  ecosystem  through  cross-play.  A  year  has  passed  and  while  we  are  still  waiting  for  the  Better  Together  Update  to  release  on  Switch,  it  is  available  now  across  Xbox,  PC,  VR,  and  Mobile,  the  promise  of  being  able  to  take  your  world  with  you  across  any  device  was  an  exciting  prospect.  While  the  announcement  pertained  to  Minecraft  the  big  question  still  lingered,  could  cross-play  between  all  the  major  consoles  finally  be  upon  us?<br><br>  Minecraft  can  be  considered  one  of  the  biggest  games  in  the  world.  Seeing as <a class="article-link" href="https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/" target="_blank">Microsoft  paid  $2.5  Billion  for  Minecraft</a> I’d  say  they  would  agree,  and  I  saw  the  announcement  as  an  opportunity  for  cross-play  to  finally  break  the  barrier  between  consoles  and  to  allow  everyone  to  play  together.  However  there  was  one  noticeable  system  missing  from  the  announcement  video,  and  that  system  just  so  happened  to  be  the  same  one  leading  this  current  console  generation  in  sales.  PlayStation  was  nowhere  to  be  found,  and  many  including  myself  had  hoped  this  was  either  a  temporary  issue  or  that  maybe  Sony  hadn’t  had  a  chance  to  finalize  the  details  yet  and  it  would  just  be  a  matter  of  time.  It  took  almost  no  time  for  an  answer.  As  the  community  and  press  started  to  ask  questions,  it  become  apparent  that  this  was  not  a  mistake  but  a  strategic  move  by  Sony.<br><br>  On  June  13th  2017,  two  days  after  the  initial  announcement  at  Microsoft’s  E3  conference,  <a class="article-link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-13-sony-defends-decision-to-block-cross-play-with-xbox-one-and-nintendo-switch" target="_blank">Eurogamer  sat  down  with  Sony’s  Jim  Ryan</a>,  head  of  global  marketing  and  sales,  to  ask  why  they  would  be  holding  out  from  cross-play  with  Minecraft.  While  he  seemed  to  express  how  much  the  community  is  interested  in  this,  the  bottom  line  was  that  Sony  was  not  interested  in  participating  at  the  time.  In  one  statement  he  expressed  concern  for  their  younger  demographic,  ͞Exposing  what  in  many  cases  are  children  to  external  influences  we  have  no  ability  to  manage  or  look  after,  its  something  we  have  to  think  about  very  carefully.͟  While  this
answer  attempts  to  evoke  a  sentiment  that  they  are  doing  what  is  best  for  their  player  base,  the  community  has  made  it  very  clear  however  that  this  is  not  what  they  want.<br><br>  In  the  last  year  we  have  seen  no  movement  from  Sony  on  this  issue  and  I  was  personally  hoping  that  this  current  E3  would  see  Sony  come  to  stage  and  announce  they  were  doing  what  is  best  for  the  players  by  joining  in  on  cross-play.  While  Minecraft  may  have  been  the  biggest  game  thus  far  to  attempt  to  get  Sony  on  board,  they  are  not  the  only  ones  trying  to  make  this  happen.  Psyonix  has  brought  cross-play  to  consoles  with  their  mega  hit  Rocket  League,  where  you  can  currently  play  between  Switch,  Xbox,  and  PC.<br><br>    This  E3  has  brought  us  what  I  think  is  the  biggest  opportunity  yet  for  cross-play  to  finally  happen,  Epic  Games’  Fortnite.  Over  the  past  year  Fortnite’s  Battle  Royale  mode  has  reached  unprecedented  levels  of  popularity  and  now  finds  itself  on  every  platform  imaginable.  This  is  largely  because  it  is  free  to  play  allowing  everyone  to  at  least  try  the  game.  However  Epic’s  commitment  to  the  community  through  updates  and  engagement  with  fans  across  social  media  has  helped  lead  to  its  <a class="article-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v4-0" target="_blank">Meteoric</a>  rise.  While  not  everyone  may  love  Fortnite  and  the  recent  explosion  of  Battle  Royale  games  can  be  attributed  to  a  combination  of  both  Fortnite  and  PubG,  it’s  hard  to  argue  against  its  success  with  the  game  making  <a class="article-link" href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/228658/20180528/fortnite-made-296-million-in-april-on-pace-to-hit-3-5-billion-in-2018.htm" target="_blank">$296  million  in  April  and  on  pace  for  $3.5  billion  for  all  of  2018</a>.  It  makes  perfect  sense  then  that  with  all  the  success  Fortnite  has  found  it  was  only  a  matter  of  time  until  it  partnered  with  Nintendo  and  found  its  way  to  the  Switch.<br><br>  Nintendo  held  its  annual  E3  Direct  yesterday  and  with  it  announced  that  <a class="article-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-switch-play-now" target="_blank">Fortnite  would  be  coming  to  Switch</a>  and  it  would  be  available  within  the  hour.  Despite  being  leaked  in  the  weeks  prior  to  E3  this  was  still  an  exciting  announcement  for  both  the  Fortnite  and  Switch  community  as  now  you  would  be  able  to  take  the  game  with  you  and  continue  to  level  up  your  Battle  Pass  even  away  from  home.  The  prospect  of  the  biggest  game  on  one  of  the  hottest  consoles  should  have  been  an  easy  Home  Run.  It  wasn’t  long  after  10am  that  as  players  started  logging  into  the  game  with  their  accounts  they  were  met  with  an  unsightly  screen.  If  you  had  at  any  point  logged  into  your  Epic  Games  account  on  a  PS4  then  you  would  not  be  able  to  use  that  account  on  the  Switch.  For  PS4  players  this  meant  either  starting  from  scratch  or  purchasing  an  additional  Battle  Pass  that  would  have  separate  progression  and  fragment  your  items  across  consoles.  For  anyone  who
used  their  account  on  IOS,  Xbox,  or  PC,  they  were  easily  able  to  sync  up  their  accounts  and  jump  right  into  a  match  with  everything  they  had  earned  and  purchased  prior.  The  reaction  from  the  PS4  community  was  understandably  outrage.<br><br>  The  reaction  over  the  past  day  has  quickly  far  exceeded  anything  we  saw  over  the  Minecraft  announcement.  With  Fortnite  players  having  invested  large  amounts  of  time  and  money  into  the  game  and  the  thought  of  having  to  leave  this  all  behind  is  one  they  will  not  stand  for.  One  Reddit  user  claimed  that  after  logging  over  700  hours  on  PC  and  only  logging  in  once  on  PS4,  he  was  now  locked  out  from  linking  his  Epic  account  to  Switch.  A <a class="article-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8qmly8/we_need_to_be_making_a_huge_deal_about_the_ps4/" target="_blank">reddit  post</a>  on  the  Fortnite  Battle  Royale  subreddit,  as  of  the  time  of  writing  this,  gained  almost  31  thousand  upvotes  and  over  2  thousand  comments  of  players  expressing  their  frustration  with  Sony’s  lack  of  cooperation  with  allowing  cross-play.  It  seems  that  Sony  is  not  going  to  be  let  off  the  hook  this  time  around  and  it  may  be  that  it  takes  the  biggest  game  in  the  world  right  now  to  finally  force  Sony’s  hand.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  in  the  coming  days,  weeks,  and  months  if  the  Fortnite  community  is  able  to  use  its  numbers  to  get  Sony’s  attention  and  show  them  that  their  current  strategy  is  not  what  the  players  want  or  support.  The  fact  that  they  are  now  the  only  ones  not  supporting  cross-play  is  only  going  to  continue  to  upset  their  supporters  and  degrade  their  image.<br><br>    If  Fortnite  is  finally  able  to  finally  break  through  and  make  this  change  happen,  it  will  only  be  better  for  the  entire  gaming  community.  Sony’s  stubbornness  and  lack  of  transparency  on  this  issue  may  turn  out  to  hurt  them  in  the  long  run  if  they  are  unable  to  keep  pace  with  the  ever-evolving  industry.  Time  will  tell  if  this  ends  up  having  any  lasting  impact  on  their  image  or  if  it  will  take  until  the  next  generation  of  consoles  and  a  potential  lead  by  Microsoft  for  Sony  to  finally  agree,  but  with  Fortnite  currently  leading  the  charge  it  seems  they  have  the  best  chance  of  anyone.</p>
