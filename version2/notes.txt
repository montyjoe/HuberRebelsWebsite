Huber rebels ideas:
  -if ever meeting famous or semi famous (we'll take what we can get in the beginning),
  we can ask them to record the answering machine for our voicemail and film it and post it
  as a mini series of videos on the channel
    ex: hey this is {insert celeberity name here} and youve reached the voicemail box of the huber rebels, {insert their
    own personal touch here}
  -guys talking games could turn into our podcast as we get more comfortable researching and talking about games,
  we can have a nice setup and stream the podcast, then upload it as an actual podcast and a video on the channel

  -currently my idea for the huber rebels is for the main channel to be about ethan and I (and whoever we invite on),
  playing and talking about games. So a lot of live action videos, talking to the camera giving reviews etc (basically video
  versions of the big stuff from the website), vlogs from trips and conventions, playthroughs of story modes of big games
  as well as any funny collections of gameplays of any games we're playing (session highlites, ideas of stuff to do in a game
  and record it, stream highlites etc).
  I would like a second channel, Huber Rebels Casual (name?) to be where we post entire stream vods, podcasts etc.
  mostly the uncut stuff that isnt playthroughs of main story but more just messing around in games or sessions of shooters
  and what not.
